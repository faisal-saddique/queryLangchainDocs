Retrieval QA
============

This example showcases question answering over an index.

The `RetrievalQAChain` is a chain that combines a `Retriever` and a QA chain (described above). It is used to retrieve documents from a `Retriever` and then use a `QA` chain to answer a question based on the retrieved documents.

Usage[](#usage "Direct link to Usage")
---------------------------------------

In the below example, we are using a `VectorStore` as the `Retriever`. By default, the `StuffDocumentsChain` is used as the `QA` chain.

    import { OpenAI } from "langchain/llms/openai";import { RetrievalQAChain } from "langchain/chains";import { HNSWLib } from "langchain/vectorstores/hnswlib";import { OpenAIEmbeddings } from "langchain/embeddings/openai";import { RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter } from "langchain/text_splitter";import * as fs from "fs";// Initialize the LLM to use to answer the question.const model = new OpenAI({});const text = fs.readFileSync("state_of_the_union.txt", "utf8");const textSplitter = new RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter({ chunkSize: 1000 });const docs = await textSplitter.createDocuments([text]);// Create a vector store from the documents.const vectorStore = await HNSWLib.fromDocuments(docs, new OpenAIEmbeddings());// Initialize a retriever wrapper around the vector storeconst vectorStoreRetriever = vectorStore.asRetriever();// Create a chain that uses the OpenAI LLM and HNSWLib vector store.const chain = RetrievalQAChain.fromLLM(model, vectorStoreRetriever);const res = await chain.call({  query: "What did the president say about Justice Breyer?",});console.log({ res });/*{  res: {    text: 'The president said that Justice Breyer was an Army veteran, Constitutional scholar,    and retiring Justice of the United States Supreme Court and thanked him for his service.'  }}*/

Custom `QA` chain[](#custom-qa-chain "Direct link to custom-qa-chain")
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

In the below example, we are using a `VectorStore` as the `Retriever` and a `MapReduceDocumentsChain` as the `QA` chain.

    import { OpenAI } from "langchain/llms/openai";import { RetrievalQAChain, loadQAMapReduceChain } from "langchain/chains";import { HNSWLib } from "langchain/vectorstores/hnswlib";import { OpenAIEmbeddings } from "langchain/embeddings/openai";import { RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter } from "langchain/text_splitter";import * as fs from "fs";// Initialize the LLM to use to answer the question.const model = new OpenAI({});const text = fs.readFileSync("state_of_the_union.txt", "utf8");const textSplitter = new RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter({ chunkSize: 1000 });const docs = await textSplitter.createDocuments([text]);// Create a vector store from the documents.const vectorStore = await HNSWLib.fromDocuments(docs, new OpenAIEmbeddings());// Create a chain that uses a map reduce chain and HNSWLib vector store.const chain = new RetrievalQAChain({  combineDocumentsChain: loadQAMapReduceChain(model),  retriever: vectorStore.asRetriever(),});const res = await chain.call({  query: "What did the president say about Justice Breyer?",});console.log({ res });/*{  res: {    text: " The president said that Justice Breyer has dedicated his life to serve his country, and thanked him for his service. He also said that Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson will continue Justice Breyer's legacy of excellence, emphasizing the importance of protecting the rights of citizens, especially women, LGBTQ+ Americans, and access to healthcare. He also expressed his commitment to supporting the younger transgender Americans in America and ensuring they are able to reach their full potential, offering a Unity Agenda for the Nation to beat the opioid epidemic and increase funding for prevention, treatment, harm reduction, and recovery."  }}*/

Custom prompts[](#custom-prompts "Direct link to Custom prompts")
------------------------------------------------------------------

You can pass in custom prompts to do question answering. These prompts are the same prompts as you can pass into the base question answering chains.

    import { OpenAI } from "langchain/llms/openai";import { RetrievalQAChain, loadQAStuffChain } from "langchain/chains";import { HNSWLib } from "langchain/vectorstores/hnswlib";import { OpenAIEmbeddings } from "langchain/embeddings/openai";import { RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter } from "langchain/text_splitter";import { PromptTemplate } from "langchain/prompts";import * as fs from "fs";const promptTemplate = `Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.{context}Question: {question}Answer in Italian:`;const prompt = PromptTemplate.fromTemplate(promptTemplate);// Initialize the LLM to use to answer the question.const model = new OpenAI({});const text = fs.readFileSync("state_of_the_union.txt", "utf8");const textSplitter = new RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter({ chunkSize: 1000 });const docs = await textSplitter.createDocuments([text]);// Create a vector store from the documents.const vectorStore = await HNSWLib.fromDocuments(docs, new OpenAIEmbeddings());// Create a chain that uses a Refine chain and HNSWLib vector store.const chain = new RetrievalQAChain({  combineDocumentsChain: loadQAStuffChain(model, { prompt }),  retriever: vectorStore.asRetriever(),});const res = await chain.call({  query: "What did the president say about Justice Breyer?",});console.log({ res });/*{  res: {    text: ' Il presidente ha elogiato Justice Breyer per il suo servizio e lo ha ringraziato.'  }}*/

Return Source Documents[](#return-source-documents "Direct link to Return Source Documents")
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Additionally, we can return the source documents used to answer the question by specifying an optional parameter when constructing the chain.
