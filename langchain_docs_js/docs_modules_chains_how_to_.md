--------------------

It can be hard to debug a Chain object solely from its output as most Chain objects involve a fair amount of input prompt preprocessing and LLM output post-processing.

-------------------------

Chains can be initialized with a Memory object, which will persist data across calls to the chain. This makes a Chain stateful.
