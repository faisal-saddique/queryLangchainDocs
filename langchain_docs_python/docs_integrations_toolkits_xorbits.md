Xorbits Agent
=============

This notebook shows how to use agents to interact with [Xorbits Pandas](https://doc.xorbits.io/en/latest/reference/pandas/index.html) dataframe and [Xorbits Numpy](https://doc.xorbits.io/en/latest/reference/numpy/index.html) ndarray. It is mostly optimized for question answering.

**NOTE: this agent calls the Python agent under the hood, which executes LLM generated Python code - this can be bad if the LLM generated Python code is harmful. Use cautiously.**
