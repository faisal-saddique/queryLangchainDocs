AzureML Online Endpoint
=======================

[AzureML](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/machine-learning/) is a platform used to build, train, and deploy machine learning models. Users can explore the types of models to deploy in the Model Catalog, which provides Azure Foundation Models and OpenAI Models. Azure Foundation Models include various open-source models and popular Hugging Face models. Users can also import models of their liking into AzureML.

This notebook goes over how to use an LLM hosted on an `AzureML online endpoint`

    from langchain.llms.azureml_endpoint import AzureMLOnlineEndpoint

Set up[](#set-up "Direct link to Set up")
------------------------------------------

To use the wrapper, you must [deploy a model on AzureML](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-use-foundation-models?view=azureml-api-2#deploying-foundation-models-to-endpoints-for-inferencing) and obtain the following parameters:

*   `endpoint_api_key`: The API key provided by the endpoint
*   `endpoint_url`: The REST endpoint url provided by the endpoint
*   `deployment_name`: The deployment name of the endpoint

Content Formatter[](#content-formatter "Direct link to Content Formatter")
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The `content_formatter` parameter is a handler class for transforming the request and response of an AzureML endpoint to match with required schema. Since there are a wide range of models in the model catalog, each of which may process data differently from one another, a `ContentFormatterBase` class is provided to allow users to transform data to their liking. Additionally, there are three content formatters already provided:

*   `OSSContentFormatter`: Formats request and response data for models from the Open Source category in the Model Catalog. Note, that not all models in the Open Source category may follow the same schema
*   `DollyContentFormatter`: Formats request and response data for the `dolly-v2-12b` model
*   `HFContentFormatter`: Formats request and response data for text-generation Hugging Face models

Below is an example using a summarization model from Hugging Face.

        Many people are willing to talk about themselves; it's others who seem to be stuck up. Try to understand others where they're coming from. Like minded people can build a tribe together.

### Serializing an LLM[](#serializing-an-llm "Direct link to Serializing an LLM")

You can also save and load LLM configurations

    from langchain.llms.loading import load_llmfrom langchain.llms.azureml_endpoint import AzureMLEndpointClientsave_llm = AzureMLOnlineEndpoint(    deployment_name="databricks-dolly-v2-12b-4",    model_kwargs={        "temperature": 0.2,        "max_tokens": 150,        "top_p": 0.8,        "frequency_penalty": 0.32,        "presence_penalty": 72e-3,    },)save_llm.save("azureml.json")loaded_llm = load_llm("azureml.json")print(loaded_llm)
