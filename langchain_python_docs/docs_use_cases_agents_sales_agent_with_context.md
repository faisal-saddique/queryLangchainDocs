SalesGPT - Your Context-Aware AI Sales Assistant With Knowledge Base
====================================================================

This notebook demonstrates an implementation of a **Context-Aware** AI Sales agent with a Product Knowledge Base.

This notebook was originally published at [filipmichalsky/SalesGPT](https://github.com/filip-michalsky/SalesGPT) by [@FilipMichalsky](https://twitter.com/FilipMichalsky).

SalesGPT is context-aware, which means it can understand what section of a sales conversation it is in and act accordingly.

As such, this agent can have a natural sales conversation with a prospect and behaves based on the conversation stage. Hence, this notebook demonstrates how we can use AI to automate sales development representatives activites, such as outbound sales calls.

Additionally, the AI Sales agent has access to tools, which allow it to interact with other systems.

Here, we show how the AI Sales Agent can use a **Product Knowledge Base** to speak about a particular's company offerings, hence increasing relevance and reducing hallucinations.

We leverage the [`langchain`](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain) library in this implementation, specifically [Custom Agent Configuration](https://langchain-langchain.vercel.app/docs/modules/agents/how_to/custom_agent_with_tool_retrieval) and are inspired by [BabyAGI](https://github.com/yoheinakajima/babyagi) architecture .

### SalesGPT architecture[​](#salesgpt-architecture "Direct link to SalesGPT architecture")

1.  Seed the SalesGPT agent
    
2.  Run Sales Agent to decide what to do:
    
    a) Use a tool, such as look up Product Information in a Knowledge Base
    
    b) Output a response to a user
    
3.  Run Sales Stage Recognition Agent to recognize which stage is the sales agent at and adjust their behaviour accordingly.
    

Here is the schematic of the architecture:

### Sales conversation stages.[​](#sales-conversation-stages "Direct link to Sales conversation stages.")

The agent employs an assistant who keeps it in check as in what stage of the conversation it is in. These stages were generated by ChatGPT and can be easily modified to fit other use cases or modes of conversation.

1.  Introduction: Start the conversation by introducing yourself and your company. Be polite and respectful while keeping the tone of the conversation professional.
    
2.  Qualification: Qualify the prospect by confirming if they are the right person to talk to regarding your product/service. Ensure that they have the authority to make purchasing decisions.
    
3.  Value proposition: Briefly explain how your product/service can benefit the prospect. Focus on the unique selling points and value proposition of your product/service that sets it apart from competitors.
    
4.  Needs analysis: Ask open-ended questions to uncover the prospect's needs and pain points. Listen carefully to their responses and take notes.
    
5.  Solution presentation: Based on the prospect's needs, present your product/service as the solution that can address their pain points.
    
6.  Objection handling: Address any objections that the prospect may have regarding your product/service. Be prepared to provide evidence or testimonials to support your claims.
    
7.  Close: Ask for the sale by proposing a next step. This could be a demo, a trial or a meeting with decision-makers. Ensure to summarize what has been discussed and reiterate the benefits.

Our high-quality mattresses are designed to meet the unique needs of our customers. Can I ask what specifically you'd like to learn more about?

        Ted Lasso:  Our mattresses are made from a variety of materials, depending on the model. We have the EcoGreen Hybrid Latex Mattress, which is made from 100% natural latex harvested from eco-friendly plantations. The Plush Serenity Bamboo Mattress features a layer of plush, adaptive foam and a base of high-resilience support foam, with a bamboo-infused top layer. The Luxury Cloud-Comfort Memory Foam Mattress has an innovative, temperature-sensitive memory foam layer and a high-density foam base with cooling gel-infused particles. Finally, the Classic Harmony Spring Mattress has a robust inner spring construction and layers of plush padding, with a quilted top layer and a natural cotton cover. Is there anything specific you'd like to know about these materials?

        Ted Lasso:  Yes, we do have queen-sized mattresses available. We offer the Luxury Cloud-Comfort Memory Foam Mattress and the Classic Harmony Spring Mattress in queen size. Both mattresses provide exceptional comfort and support. Is there anything specific you would like to know about these options?

        Conversation Stage: Solution presentation: Based on the prospect's needs, present your product/service as the solution that can address their pain points.

    sales_agent.step()

        Ted Lasso:  The Luxury Cloud-Comfort Memory Foam Mattress is priced at $999 and is available in Twin, Queen, and King sizes. It features an innovative, temperature-sensitive memory foam layer and a high-density foam base. On the other hand, the Classic Harmony Spring Mattress is priced at $1,299 and is available in Queen and King sizes. It features a robust inner spring construction and layers of plush padding. Both mattresses provide exceptional comfort and support, but the Classic Harmony Spring Mattress may be a better option if you prefer the traditional feel of an inner spring mattress. Do you have any other questions about these options?
