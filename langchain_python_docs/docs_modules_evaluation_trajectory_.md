üìÑÔ∏è Custom Trajectory Evaluator
-------------------------------

You can make your own custom trajectory evaluators by inheriting from the AgentTrajectoryEvaluator class and overwriting the evaluateagenttrajectory (and aevaluateagentaction) method.

üìÑÔ∏è Agent Trajectory
--------------------

Agents can be difficult to holistically evaluate due to the breadth of actions and generation they can make. We recommend using multiple evaluation techniques appropriate to your use case. One way to evaluate an agent is to look at the whole trajectory of actions taken along with their responses.
