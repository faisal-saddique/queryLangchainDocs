Infino - LangChain LLM Monitoring Example
=========================================

This example shows how one can track the following while calling OpenAI models via LangChain and [Infino](https://github.com/infinohq/infino):

*   prompt input,
*   response from chatgpt or any other LangChain model,
*   latency,
*   errors,
*   number of tokens consumed
