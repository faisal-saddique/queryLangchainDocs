Examples
========

Examples are input/output pairs that represent inputs to a function and then expected output. They can be used in both training and evaluation of models.

These can be inputs/outputs for a model or for a chain. Both types of examples serve a different purpose. Examples for a model can be used to finetune a model. Examples for a chain can be used to evaluate the end-to-end chain, or maybe even train a model to replace that whole chain.
