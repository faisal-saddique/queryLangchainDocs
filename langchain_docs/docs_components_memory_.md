Memory is the concept of storing and retrieving data in the process of a conversation. There are two main methods:

1.  Based on input, fetch any relevant pieces of data
2.  Based on the input and output, update state accordingly

There are two main types of memory: short term and long term.

Short term memory generally refers to how to pass data in the context of a singular conversation (generally is previous ChatMessages or summaries of them).

Long term memory deals with how to fetch and update information between conversations.
