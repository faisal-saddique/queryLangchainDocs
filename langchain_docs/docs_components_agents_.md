Some applications will require not just a predetermined chain of calls to LLMs/other tools, but potentially an unknown chain that depends on the user's input. In these types of chains, there is a “agent” which has access to a suite of tools. Depending on the user input, the agent can then decide which, if any, of these tools to call.

We split the documentation into the following sections:

**Tools**

How language models interact with other resources.

**Agents**

The language model that drives decision making.

**Toolkits**

Sets of tools that when used together can accomplish a specific task.

**Agent Executor**

The logic for running agents with tools.
