LLMChain
========

A LLMChain is the most common type of chain. It consists of a PromptTemplate, a model (either an LLM or a ChatModel), and an optional output parser. This chain takes multiple input variables, uses the PromptTemplate to format them into a prompt. It then passes that to the model. Finally, it uses the OutputParser (if provided) to parse the output of the LLM into a final format.
