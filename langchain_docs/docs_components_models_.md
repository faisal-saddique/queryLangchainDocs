This section of the documentation deals with different types of models that are used in LangChain. On this page we will go over the model types at a high level, but we have individual pages for each model type.

**LLMs**

Large Language Models (LLMs) are the first type of models we cover. These models take a text string as input, and return a text string as output.

**Chat Models**

Chat Models are the second type of models we cover. These models are usually backed by a language model, but their APIs are more structured. Specifically, these models take a list of Chat Messages as input, and return a Chat Message.

**Text Embedding Models**

The third type of models we cover are text embedding models. These models take text as input and return a list of floats.
