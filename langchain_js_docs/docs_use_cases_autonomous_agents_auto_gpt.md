Original Repo: [https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT)

AutoGPT is a custom agent that uses long-term memory along with a prompt designed for independent work (ie. without asking user input) to perform tasks.

Isomorphic Example[​](#isomorphic-example "Direct link to Isomorphic Example")
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this example we use AutoGPT to predict the weather for a given location. This example is designed to run in all JS environments, including the browser.

Node.js Example[​](#nodejs-example "Direct link to Node.js Example")
--------------------------------------------------------------------

In this example we use AutoGPT to predict the weather for a given location. This example is designed to run in Node.js, so it uses the local filesystem, and a Node-only vector store.

    import { AutoGPT } from "langchain/experimental/autogpt";import { ReadFileTool, WriteFileTool, SerpAPI } from "langchain/tools";import { NodeFileStore } from "langchain/stores/file/node";import { HNSWLib } from "langchain/vectorstores/hnswlib";import { OpenAIEmbeddings } from "langchain/embeddings/openai";import { ChatOpenAI } from "langchain/chat_models/openai";const store = new NodeFileStore();const tools = [  new ReadFileTool({ store }),  new WriteFileTool({ store }),  new SerpAPI(process.env.SERPAPI_API_KEY, {    location: "San Francisco,California,United States",    hl: "en",    gl: "us",  }),];const vectorStore = new HNSWLib(new OpenAIEmbeddings(), {  space: "cosine",  numDimensions: 1536,});const autogpt = AutoGPT.fromLLMAndTools(  new ChatOpenAI({ temperature: 0 }),  tools,  {    memory: vectorStore.asRetriever(),    aiName: "Tom",    aiRole: "Assistant",  });await autogpt.run(["write a weather report for SF today"]);/*{    "thoughts": {        "text": "I need to write a weather report for SF today.
